# JurassicParkSCADA

A C++ SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) simulation themed around **Jurassic Park** — designed to model real-time monitoring and control of critical systems (e.g., environmental sensors, enclosure gates, alarms, actuators).

This project demonstrates core control-systems concepts, event loops, sensor abstraction, alarms, and basic human-machine interface (HMI) logic in a maintainable C++ codebase.

## 🧠 Concept & Goals

This is a **systems simulation** that:

- Models distributed sensors and actuators  
- Implements a control loop for periodic data updates  
- Detects and handles threshold breaches (alarms)  
- Logs system state and alerts  
- Demonstrates real-world SCADA design patterns

The **Jurassic Park theming** adds fun context but the code focuses on **software architecture, safety logic, and real-time processing**.
